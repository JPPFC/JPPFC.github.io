            <h3>Blow Up Your Video</h3>
            
            <p>Blow Up Your Video é o décimo primeiro álbum de estúdio da banda AC/DC, não foi muito bem sucedido como os álbuns anteriores: Back In Black de 1980 e For Those About to Rock (We Salute You) de 1981. Foi lançado em 18 de Janeiro de 1988. Durante a turnê do disco, Malcolm teve problemas com a bebida e foi substituído por seu sobrinho no fim da turnê. Por serem parecidos, não causou tanto impacto nos fãs pois não teve tanta divulgação como os outros álbuns. Apesar do fracasso relativo, traz músicas como "Heatseeker" e "That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll" sendo as principais músicas do álbum.</p>

          Last stand<br>
Down to my last dime<br>
I ain't got the sense to leave<br>
The dealers cutting fine<br>
Last throw<br>
Back against the wall<br>
Depending where the money is<br>
Is where I'm gonna fall<br>
Ace high<br>
Hide your poker eyes<br>
I didn't wanna laugh too much when<br>
When I picked up the prize<br>
Lady luck<br>
Is standing at my side<br>
I leave with more than I brought in<br>
And get out with my life<br>
Get out with my life<br>
<br>
I go, you go<br>
She go, we go<br>
Two's up<br>
Two's up<br>
Gimme head, gimme tails<br>
Gimme double up an' comin'<br>
Doubled over on the rails<br>
Gimme two's up<br>
That's what I want<br>
<br>
High up<br>
When you're lookin' down<br>
Then you see two animals just foolin' you around<br>
Stray dogs<br>
Gonna take them in<br>
Don't know what your names are<br>
Where you're goin' and where ya been<br>
All day it's difficult to say, who is doin'<br>
What was doing what to who, who's callin' out the play<br>
I love, the way you slide an' slip<br>
I like the way you girls work out<br>
And make a partnership<br>
Make that partnership<br>
I go, you go<br>
She go, we go<br>
Two's up<br>
Yes it's a two's up<br>
Gimme head, gimme tails<br>
Gimme double up an' comin'<br>
Doubled over on the rails<br>
Gimme<br>
Gotta gimme double or quits<br>
<br>
Two's up<br>
Two's up<br>
Like your partnership<br>
Like the way you slip<br>
There ain't nothing like a<br>
That's the way it is<br>
That's what I wanna hear<br>
Gimme head, gimme tails<br>
Gimme double up an' comin'<br>
Over on the rails<br>
Slow combustion<br>
Drive me wild<br>
Gimme head, gimme you<br>
Gimme twice the satisfaction<br>
Twice as far to go<br>
And it's a two's up<br>
Gonna be two's up<br>
We're gonna have a two's up<br>
Two's up<br>
Two's up<br>
There ain't nothing like a<br>
Two's up

          Keep your head down<br>
<br>
I<br>
I want you<br>
I want you to<br>
I want you to march<br>
Eyes goes right, shoulder arms<br>
Left wheel turn, show your charms<br>
Change your clothes, cut your hair<br>
Ain't no joke, ain't no place for kids<br>
<br>
When the flags are high, hear the battle cry<br>
The treaty gone, see the bandits fly<br>
Dig the trench, watch the blast<br>
Shell shock come, coming fast<br>
Name and rank, on parade<br>
We might get laid by a hand grenade<br>
Do you know what it means<br>
Do you know what it means<br>
This<br>
Means<br>
War<br>
This means war<br>
This means war<br>
This means war<br>
I said this means war<br>
This means war<br>
This means war<br>
The bullet got your number on it<br>
Run for cover<br>
Hit the dirt<br>
Call for your mother<br>
Yeah<br>
I<br>
I need you<br>
I need you to<br>
I need you to fire<br>
Cock your gun, wet your sights<br>
Get the bull, dead to rights<br>
Volunteer, one pace back<br>
On the beach<br>
Ain't no place for kids<br>
Well the flack is high on the bomber run<br>
You don't talk back to an ack ack gun<br>
The fire rage and your in a blitz<br>
Keep your head or you're blown to bits<br>
Name and rank on parade<br>
We might get laid by a hand grenade<br>
You know what it means<br>
Do you know what it means<br>
This<br>
Means<br>
War<br>
<br>
Who go there is it friend or foe<br>
Propaganda time on the radio<br>
Top brass shout as they clown around<br>
And the peace talks die in Geneva town<br>
Do you know what it means<br>
Do you know what it means<br>
Do you know what it means<br>
Do you know what it means<br>
This<br>
Means war<br>
This<br>
Means war<br>
I said this means war<br>
This means war<br>
This<br>
Means war<br>
Where's the 7th Calvary<br>
<br>
This means war, told you before<br>
I said this<br>
Means war, you know the score<br>
I said this means war<br>
This means war<br>
This<br>
Means<br>
War<br>
<br>
You're all dead
