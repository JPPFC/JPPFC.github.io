            <h3>Powerage</h3>
            
            <p>Powerage é o quinto álbum de estúdio da banda australiana de hard rock AC/DC, lançado em 25 de Maio de 1978, e também é o primeiro álbum que não contém uma faixa homônima. O álbum conta com faixas históricas que vieram a se tornar um dos maiores clássicos de todos os tempos. Guitarristas como Slash, Keith Richards, Eddie Van Halen, Gene Simmons, Ron Wood afirmam sua paixão pelo AC/DC, tendo como em especial o álbum Powerage. É o primeiro trabalho com o baixista Cliff Williams, que entrou substituindo Mark Evans. Anos depois, Evans afirmou que parte do álbum contém linhas de baixo tocadas por ele.</p>

You say that you want respect<br>
Honey for what<br>
For everything that you done for me<br>
Thanks a lot<br>
Get up off your bended knees<br>
You can set your mind at ease<br>
My temperature's runnin' hot<br>

Damnation, they're putting you down<br>
Damnation, all over town<br>
Damnation, Cause you're way outta reach<br>
Living on the street you gotta practice what you preach<br>
An it's a rock 'n' roll damnation<br>
Ma's own whippin' boy<br>
Rock 'n' roll damnation<br>
Take a chance while you still got the choice<br>

Damnation, you left a happy home<br>
Damnation, To live on your own<br>
Damnation, You wanna live in sin<br>
It's a rock 'n' roll<br>

Damnation, you got the dollars in your eye<br>
Always chasin' that pie in the sky<br>

A fifty cent millionaire<br>
Open to charity<br>
Rock 'n' roll welfare<br>
Sitting in my Cadillac<br>
Listening to my radio<br>
Suzy baby get on in<br>
Tell me where she wanna go<br>
I'm living in a nightmare<br>
She's looking like a wet dream<br>
I got myself a Cadillac<br>
But I can't afford the gasoline<br>
I got holes in my shoes<br>
And I'm way overdue<br>
Down payment blues<br>
<br>
Get myself a steady job<br>
Some responsibility<br>
Can't even feed my cat<br>
On social security<br>
Hiding from the rent man<br>
Oh it make me wanna cry<br>
Sheriff knocking on my door<br>
Ain't it funny how the time flies<br>
Sitting on my sailing boat<br>
Sipping on my champagne<br>
Suzy baby all at sea<br>
Say she wanna come again<br>
Feeling like a paper cup<br>
Floating down a storm drain<br>
Got myself a sailing boat<br>
But I can't afford a drop of rain<br>
I got holes in my shoes<br>
And I'm way overdue<br>
Down payment blues<br>
