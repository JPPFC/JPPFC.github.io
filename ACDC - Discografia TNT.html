          My Daddy was workin' nine to five<br />
When my Momma was havin' me<br />
By the time I was half alive<br />
They knew what I was gonna be<br />
I left school and grew my hair<br />
They didn't understand<br />
They wanted me to be respected as<br />
A doctor or a lawyer man<br />
(But I had other plans)<br />
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer<br />
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star<br />
<br />
Well I worked real hard and bought myself<br />
A rock 'n' roll guitar<br />
I gotta be on top some day<br />
I wanna be a star<br />
I can see my name in lights<br />
And I can see the queue<br />
I got the devil in my blood<br />
Tellin' me what to do<br />
(And I'm all ears)<br />
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer<br />
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star<br />
(I hear it pays well)<br />
You can stick your nine to five livin'<br />
And your collar and your tie<br />
And stick your moral standards<br />
'Cause it's all a dirty lie<br />
You can stick your golden handshake<br />
And you can stick your silly rules<br />
And all the other shit<br />
That they teach to kids in school<br />
('Cause I ain't no fool)<br />
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer<br />
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star<br />
Yes I are!

She gave me the King<br />
She was wheelin' and dealin'<br />
Just doin' her thing<br />
She was holdin' a pair<br />
But I had to try<br />
Her Deuce was wild<br />
But my Ace was high<br />
But how was I to know<br />
That she'd been dealt with before<br />
Said she'd never had a Full House<br />
But I should have known<br />
From the tattoo on her left leg<br />
And the garter on her right<br />
She'd have the card to bring me down<br />
If she played it right<br />
She's got the Jack<br />
Poker face was her name<br />
Poker face was her nature<br />
Poker straight was her game<br />
If she knew she could get you<br />
She play'd 'em fast<br />
She play'd 'em hard<br />
She could close her eyes<br />
And feel every card<br />
But how was I to know<br />
That she'd been shuffled before<br />
Said she'd never had a Royal Flush<br />
But I should have known<br />
That all the cards were comin'<br />
From the bottom of the pack<br />
And if I'd known what she was dealin' out<br />
I'd have dealt it back<br />
She's got the Jack
