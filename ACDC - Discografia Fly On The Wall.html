          Fly on the wall<br>
<br>
You can dance, through the night<br>
Rock 'n' roll music itching to fight<br>
Making love, drunk or stoned<br>
Looking for dollar, get broken boned<br>
It's a game, too tough to tame<br>
Ends up the same, sweating out the rain<br>
<br>
I was trapped, like a fly on the wall<br>
I was caged, like a zoo animal<br>
No escape, from the fate that you make<br>
You're a snake, I've had all I can take<br>
Watch out, there's a fly on the wall<br>
<br>
Take a chance, take a bite<br>
Rock 'n' roll devil take me tonight<br>
Like a bitch, making heat<br>
Beating on my chest, licking at my feet<br>
It's a game, too tough to tame<br>
Ending up the same, sweating out the rain<br>
So watch out, there's a fly on the wall<br>
<br>
I was trapped, like a fly on the wall<br>
I was caged, like a zoo animal<br>
No escape, from the fate that you make<br>
You're a snake, I've had all I can take<br>
<br>
I was, trapped, like a fly on the wall<br>
I was caged, like a zoo animal<br>
No escape, from the fate that you make<br>
You're a snake, I've had all I can take<br>
I was trapped, like a fly on the wall<br>
I was caged, like a zoo animal<br>
Enraged, from the fate that you make<br>
You're a snake, I've had all I can take<br>
<br>
There's a fly on the Wall

Feeling good cause the city's alive<br>
I'm getting ready to rock and jive<br>
I get up and I slide across the floor<br>
You wanna come an' I'll meet you at the door<br>
No one can stop us cause we're feeling too right<br>

She's getting hotter off the heat on me<br>
I was oiling, she was slick<br>
Licking off the sweat, her favorite trick<br>
Help me, help me please, tame this animal, and help me to breathe<br>
I said no, no way, you gotta come with me, all the way<br>
OK I'll play<br>

Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations<br>

She had the sugar and I had the wine<br>
Took my hand shook me to the core<br>
I told her not to touch but she was coming back for more<br>
You know what for<br>

Send for the man<br>
<br>
You like a dream<br>
Dirty low and mean<br>
You're good enough to eat<br>
You're sticky hot and sweet<br>
Need a shot of rhythm and loving<br>
You make a black sheep a ram<br>
This ain't no gun in my pocket<br>
I got the goods in my hand<br>
<br>
Send for the man<br>
Send for the man<br>
<br>
Send for the man<br>
<br>
Send for the man<br>
Keep away from that decadent Dan<br>
Send for the man<br>
He won't give a damn<br>
<br>
Send for the man, Send for the man<br>
Send for the man, Send for the man
