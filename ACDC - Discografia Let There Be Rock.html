          Ruby, Ruby where you been so long<br>
Done took to drinkin' whiskey<br>
Baby since you been gone<br>
Ain't no one I know<br>
Do it good as you<br>
Lickin' on that lickin' stick<br>
The way you do<br>
You got the lips to make a strong man weak<br>
And a heathen pray<br>
Give you a tip<br>
It ain't just the way you speak<br>
You know it's just the way you go down<br>
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br>
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br>
<br>
Mary, Mary you're the one for me<br>
And the way you hum<br>
Sting me like a bumble bee<br>
I'll be round to see you 'bout<br>
'bout half past ten<br>
Ain't felt this good<br>
Since I don't know when<br>
You got the touch that I need so much<br>
In your finger tips<br>
I got the honey that ya love to taste<br>
On those lovely lips<br>
So go down<br>
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br>
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br>
<br>
Baby rub it on<br>
Ya know it's sticky and it's sweet<br>
And it's been so long<br>
Ain't no one else<br>
Got a touch like you<br>
I let you do the things to me I let no other woman do<br>
Feels good<br>
Feels good<br>
Oh yeah<br>
You do it like you should<br>
Oh yeah<br>
I love you so much<br>
Make me glad I'm a man<br>
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br>
Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down

          In the beginning<br>
Back in nineteen fifty five<br>
Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show<br>
And all that jive<br>
The white man had the schmaltz<br>
The black man had the blues<br>
No one knew what they was gonna do<br>
But Tchaikovsky had the news<br>
He said let there be sound<br>
There was sound<br>
Let there be light<br>
There was light<br>
Let there be drums<br>
There was drums<br>
Let there be guitar<br>
There was guitar<br>
Let there be rock<br>
<br>
And it came to pass<br>
That rock 'n' roll was born<br>
All across the land every rockin' band<br>
Was blowin' up a storm<br>
And the guitar man got famous<br>
The business man got rich<br>
And in every bar there was a superstar<br>
With a seven year itch<br>
There was fifteen million fingers<br>
Learnin' how to play<br>
And you could hear the fingers pickin'<br>
And this is what they had to say<br>
Let there be light<br>
Sound<br>
Drums<br>
Guitar<br>
Let there be rock<br>
<br>
One night in the club called the shakin' hand<br>
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band<br>
And the music was good and the music was loud<br>
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd<br>
Let there be rock

There was trouble brewin' in my home town<br>
It was the seventh day I was the seventh son<br>
And it scared the hell out of every one<br>
They said stop<br>
I said go<br>
They said fast<br>
I said slow<br>
They said yes<br>

I do the bad boy boogie<br>
<br>
Bein' a bad boy ain't that bad<br>
I had me more dirty women than most men ever had<br>
All you women come along with me<br>
And I'll show how good a bad boy can be<br>
I said right<br>
And they said left<br>
I said east<br>
And they said west<br>
I said up<br>
And they said down<br>
I do the bad boy boogie<br>
All over town<br>
<br>
I wouldn't tell you no story<br>
Tell you no lie<br>
I was born to love till the day I die<br>
I just line em up<br>
And I knock em down<br>
And they all came a runnin' when the word got around<br>
Just keep runnin'<br>
I said up<br>
They said down<br>
They said straight<br>
I said round<br>
They said lost<br>
I said found<br>
I said free<br>
They said bound<br>
