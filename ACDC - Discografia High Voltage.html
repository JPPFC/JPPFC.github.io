Underneath that old apple tree<br>
Sitting with a handful of flowers<br>
Looking as cool as can be<br>
We talked away a couple of hours<br>
Then she laid her hand on my lap<br>
Oh I thought I got to be dreaming<br>
I didn't know I fell in her trap.<br>

Slowly getting near to my spine<br>
Killing off each last little feeling<br>
Ooh everyone she could find<br>
And when she had me hollow and naked, yeah<br>

Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me<br>
Stuck it in and turned it around.<br>
