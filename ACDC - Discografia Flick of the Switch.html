          Dog day Tuesday<br>
Hope that girl she come today<br>
Hard life it's a city life<br>
Sweat keep pourin' down<br>
I've got my feet up like to love<br>
Through the dawn till I've blown<br>
All I want's her lovin' down<br>
Love the way she move around<br>
Need no excuse<br>
To let it all hang loose<br>
My body's blown a fuse<br>
Rising power<br>
We'll raise the night<br>
Rising power<br>
Rising power<br>
We'll wake the dead<br>
Rising power<br>
<br>
You've got a love life up all night<br>
Darkest hour at the dead of night<br>
Seen her walkin' down the street<br>
The kind of woman that brings on heat<br>
Loved her dusk till dawn<br>
Come the morning she was gone<br>
Took me out to my surprise<br>
Money's gone left high and dry<br>
Need no excuse<br>
To let it all hang loose<br>
My body's blown a fuse<br>
Rising power<br>
We'll raise the night<br>
Rising power<br>
Rising power<br>
We'll wake the dead<br>
Rising power<br>
You'll end up torn to shreds<br>

          Alright hold tight<br>
I really wanna ball tonight<br>
On a bender no space defender<br>
A joy on the floor I'll get it tight<br>
Toe to toe with a black widow<br>
Fee fi fum smell the blood of rock 'n' roll<br>
All out drive on a rockin' suicide<br>
My feet are jumpin' she's a joy to ride<br>
Joy to ride, joy to ride<br>
She's a joy to ride on a rockin' suicide<br>
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
All I can take<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
<br>
She's a mean lean rockin' machine<br>
A hip huggin' blue jean dream<br>
She's a woman worth givin'<br>
A sweet sweet kissin'<br>
Lips are runnin' round on me<br>
Toe to toe with a black widow<br>
Fee fi fum smell the blood of rock 'n' roll<br>
All out drive on a rockin' suicide<br>
My feet are jumpin' she's a joy to ride<br>
Joy to ride, joy to ride<br>
She's a joy to ride on a rockin' suicide<br>
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
Ready to shake<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
For mercy's sake<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
Cause she's a joy to ride<br>
Joy to ride, joy to ride<br>
She's an all out drive on a rockin' suicide<br>
Brain shake<br>
<br>
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
Ready to shake<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
For mercy's sake<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
All I could take<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
You can't fake<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
Well it's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
For mercy's sake<br>
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake<br>
It's a brain<br>
It's a brain<br>
It's a brain<br>
