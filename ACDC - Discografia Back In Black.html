          Idle juvenile on the street on the street<br>
Kickin' everything with his feet with his feet<br>
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law of the law<br>
Don't kick don't fight don't sleep at night<br>
And shake a leg<br>
Shake a leg<br>
Shake a leg<br>
Shake it again<br>
<br>
Keepin' outta trouble with eyes in the back of my face<br>
Kickin' ass in the class and they tell me I'm a damn disgrace<br>
They tell me what they think but they stink and I really don't care<br>
Got a mind of my own move on get outta my hair<br>
Shake a leg shake your head<br>
Shake a leg wake the dead<br>
Shake a leg get stuck in<br>
Shake a leg shake a leg<br>
<br>
Mob scenes, wet dreams, dirty women on machines for me<br>
Big licks skin flicks tricky dicks are my chemistry<br>
Goin' against the grain tryin to keep me sane with you<br>
So stop your grinnin' and drop your linen for me<br>
Shake a leg shake your head<br>
Shake a leg wake the dead<br>
Shake a leg get stuck in<br>
Shake a leg shake a leg<br>
Shake it<br>
<br>
Idle juvenile on the street on the street<br>
Kickin' everything with his feet with his feet<br>
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law of the law<br>
Spittin' and bitin' and kickin' and fightin' for more<br>
Shake a leg shake your head<br>
Shake a leg wake the dead<br>
Shake a leg get stuck in<br>
Shake a leg play to win<br>
Shake a leg shake your head<br>
Shake a leg wake the dead<br>
Shake a leg get stuck in<br>
Shake a leg<br>
Shake a leg<br>
<br>
Shake it

          Hey there all you middle men<br>
Throw away your fancy clothes<br>
And while you're out sittin' on a fence<br>
So get off your arse and come down here<br>
Cause rock 'n' roll ain't no riddle man<br>
To me it makes good good sense<br>
Good sense yeah let's go<br>
<br>
Heavy decibels are playing on my guitar<br>
We got vibrations comin' up from the floor<br>
We're just listenin' to the rock<br>
That's givin' too much noise<br>
Are you deaf you wanna hear some more<br>
We're just talking about the future<br>
Forget about the past<br>
It'll always be with us<br>
It's never gonna die<br>
Never gonna die<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution<br>
Rock 'n' roll it will survive<br>
Yes it will<br>
<br>
I took a look inside your bedroom door<br>
You looked so good lyin' on your bed<br>
Well I asked you if you wanted any rhythm and love<br>
You said you wanna rock 'n' roll instead<br>
We're just talking about the future<br>
Forget about the past<br>
It'll always be with us<br>
It's never gonna die<br>
Never gonna die<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution<br>
Rock 'n' roll is just rock 'n' roll<br>
<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution<br>
Rock 'n' rolling will survive<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution<br>
Rock 'n' roll will never die<br>
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution<br>
Rock 'n' roll<br>
Rock 'n' roll<br>
<br>
Is just rock 'n' roll
