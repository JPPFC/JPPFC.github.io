Let's make it, don't waste it<br>
Let's make it come on and taste it<br>
<br>
I'll be your ladies man<br>
If you give me the chance<br>
We'll keep on jumpin' 'til the music run dry<br>
And if we take a rest<br>
We'll smoke some cigarettes<br>
And start a smokin' goin' out of control<br>
Let's make it, don't waste it<br>
Let's make it come on and taste it<br>
Let's make it, don't waste it<br>
Let's make it come on and taste it<br>
<br>
Let's not waste it<br>
We're gonna make it<br>
<br>
Let's make it, don't waste it<br>
Let's make it come on and taste it<br>
Let's make it, don't waste it<br>
Let's make it come on and taste it<br>
<br>
Let's not waste it<br>
We're gonna make it<br>
<br>
Let's make it, don't waste it<br>
Let's make it come on and taste it<br>
Let's make it, don't waste it<br>
Let's make it come on and taste it

          Gettin' bombed out on booze<br>
Got nothin' to lose<br>
Run outta money<br>
Disposable blues<br>
Sleazy hotels like livin' in hell<br>
The girls on the hustle with nothin' to sell<br>
Want something for nothing it's always the same<br>
Keep pushin' an' shovin' and I'm down on the game<br>
Always in trouble<br>
Forever detained<br>
Goodbye goodbye goodbye and good riddance to bad luck<br>
<br>
Well spread out the news there's a free man loose<br>
Back out of jail and chasin' some floos'<br>
Bad luck has changed<br>
Broken the chains<br>
Laid out a claim for monetary gains<br>
Wantin' what's coming all for the take<br>
Freedom for lovin' an lust for the taste<br>
Eyes are wide open<br>
Wild to the game<br>
Goodbye goodbye goodbye and good riddance to bad luck<br>
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck<br>
<br>
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck<br>
Bad luck<br>
Bad luck<br>
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck<br>
Goodbye good riddance to bad luck<br>
Broken the chains of bad luck<br>
Bye bye bye bad luck<br>
Thrown of the chains of bad luck<br>
<br>
Goodbye good riddance<br>
To bad luck
