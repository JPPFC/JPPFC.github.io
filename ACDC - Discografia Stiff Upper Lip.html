          Picking up the sleaze in my car<br>
Hell no distance too far<br>
Burning down the road in the night<br>
Don't you scold me or I'll bite<br>

These are the finer things in life<br>
Don't think you live in paradise<br>
I've got my filly wrapped in red<br>
Upon my double decker bed<br>
<br>
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)<br>
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)<br>
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)<br>
If you want it come and get it<br>

Suckin' up the juice in the bar<br>
Downin' every shooter so far<br>
Checkin' out the girls what a sight<br>
If you gonna blow me do it right<br>
