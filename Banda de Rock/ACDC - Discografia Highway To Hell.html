She stealin' the spotlight<br>
Knocks me off my feet<br>
She's enough to start a landslide<br>
Just a walkin' down the street<br>
Wearin' dresses so tight<br>

About to blow me out<br>
No doubt about it can't live without it<br>

Too much for any man<br>
She give me first degree<br>
She really satisfy me<br>
Love me 'til I'm legless<br>
Achin' and sore<br>
Enough to stop a freight train<br>
Or start the third world war<br>
You know I'm losin' sleep<br>
But I'm in too deep<br>
Like a body needs blood<br>
No doubt about it can't live without it<br>

Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) baby<br>

And everythin' comes into view<br>
She was takin' her time I was losin' my mind<br>
There was nothin' that she wouldn't do<br>
It wasn't the first, it wasn't the last<br>
She knew we was makin' love<br>
I was so satisfied, deep down inside<br>
Like a hand in a velvet glove<br>
Seems like a touch, a touch too much<br>
Seems like a touch, a touch too much<br>
Too much for my body<br>
Too much for my brain<br>
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane<br>
She got a touch<br>
A touch too much<br>

She had the face of an angel smilin' with sin<br>
The body of Venus with arms<br>
Dealin' with danger strokin' my skin<br>
Like a thunder and lightnin' storm<br>
It wasn't the first, it wasn't the last<br>
It wasn't that she didn't care<br>
She wanted it hard, wanted it fast<br>
She liked it done medium rare<br>
Seems like a touch, a touch too much<br>

Too much for my body<br>
Too much for my brain<br>

Seems like a touch<br>
Just a dirty little touch<br>
I really need your touch<br>
Cause you're much too much too much too much<br>
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)<br>
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)<br>
Givin' me a touch (a touch too much)<br>
Lay me down and touch (a touch too much)<br>
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)<br>

Baby I got my eye on you<br>
Cause you do all the things I want you to<br>
Stop your cryin' and dry you tears<br>
I ain't that wet behind the ears<br>
You can throw me lefts<br>
You can throw me rights<br>
But where was you last night<br>
Beating around the bush<br>
<br>
Wish I knew what was on your mind<br>
Why you bein' so unkind<br>
Remember those nights we spent alone<br>
Talking on the telephone<br>
Thoughts of you goin' throw my brain<br>
You told me that you felt the same<br>
You said that you loved me too<br>
But tell me who was there with you<br>
I was talkin' birds<br>
And you was talkin' bees<br>
And was he down upon his knees<br>
Beating around the bush<br>

Your the meanest woman I've ever known<br>
Sticks and stones won't break my bones<br>
I know what you're lookin' for<br>
You've eaten your cake you want some more<br>
I'm gonna give you just one more chance<br>
Try to save our romance<br>
I've done everything<br>
I'm gonna do<br>
The rest is up to you<br>
And you can chew it up<br>
You can spit it out<br>
You can let it all hang out<br>
Beating around the bush<br>

Chew it up<br>
Spit it out<br>
Let it all hang out<br>

          Somewhere a clock strikes midnight<br>
And there's a full moon in the sky<br>
You hear a dog bark in the distance<br>
You hear someone's baby cry<br>
A rat runs down the alley<br>
And a chill runs down your spine<br>
And someone walks across your grave<br>
And you wish the sun would shine<br>
Cause no one's gonna warn you<br>
And no one's gonna yell attack<br>
And you don't feel the steel<br>
Till it's hangin' out your back<br>
I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day<br>
Night prowler, get outta my way<br>
I'm the prowler, watch out tonight<br>
Yes I'm your night prowler, when you turn out the light<br>
<br>
Too scared to turn your light out<br>
Cause there's somethin' on your mind<br>
Was that a noise outside the window<br>
What's that shadow on the blind<br>
As you lie there naked<br>
Like a body in a tomb<br>
Suspended animation as I slip into your room<br>
I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day<br>
Night prowler, get outta my way<br>
Look out for the night prowler, watch out tonight<br>
Yes I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light<br>
<br>
I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day<br>
Yes I'm your night prowler, get outta my way<br>
Look out for the night prowler, watch out tonight<br>
Yes I'm your night prowler, when you turn out the light<br>
I'm your night prowler, break down your door<br>
I'm your night prowler, crawling across your floor<br>
I'm the night prowler, make a mess of you, yes I will<br>
Night prowler<br>
And I'm telling this to you<br>
There ain't nothing<br>
There ain't nothing<br>
Nothing you can do<br>
